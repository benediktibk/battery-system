open:
TMG1-01: footprint

done:
power supply: L6982CDR instead of L6982C33DR
power supply: wrong inductance (too low maximum frequency)
Q1 and Q4: pull down for gates (charge and discharge), 220kOhm
CELL1, CELL2, CELL3, CELL4: add 100nF buffers
120 Ohm: fix order number (is actually 150 Ohm)
size: limit to cheap size of JLCPCB
Q34, Q35, Q36, Q37, Q39: pull downs on gate
Q38: pull up on gate to 3V3 and with zener diode to PACK_EXT
Q40: choose smaller PMOS
bat54ws: bigger pads
TJ40S04M3L: courtyard (J25)
connectors: use actual connectors instead of M6 holes
stencil: weird negative holes
JTAG socket: footprint
add heatsink
BOM export: connectors
