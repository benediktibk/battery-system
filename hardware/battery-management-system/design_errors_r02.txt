open:

done:
cell voltage measurements are not using the proper inputs for the opamps
jtag connector: courtyard too small (cable connector is actually bigger)
courtyard phoenix connectors (cable connectors are actually bigger)
polarity protection: replace diodes in series with anti parallel diodes, which in case of a fault short the fuse
heatsink: uses complete top/bottom layer, not only a courtyard
heatsink: thermal vias are required for actual heat transfer
