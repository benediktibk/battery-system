bat54ws: bigger pads
power supply: wrong inductance (too low maximum frequency)
power supply: L6982CDR instead of L6982C33DR
connectors: use actual connectors instead of M6 holes
stencil: weird negative holes
size: limit to cheap size of JLCPCB
BOM export: connectors
TMG1-01: footprint
JTAG socket: footprint
TJ40S04M3L: courtyard (J25)
Q1 and Q4: pull down for gates (charge and discharge), 220kOhm
120 Ohm: fix order number (is actually 150 Ohm)
